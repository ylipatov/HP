                With an emphasis on offering the best puppies possible from the healthiest and most socially adjusted
                dogs, we visit many of our breeders on a monthly basis. If you are looking for a purebred puppy with us,
                you can do so with confidence. We have our own network
                of breeders that we work with and do not purchase our puppies from “brokers.” We are proud to be Canine
                Care Certified – Canine Care Certified goes above and beyond currently available canine welfare
                standards programs. The program sets forth rigorous, science-based, expert-reviewed standards for canine
                physical and behavioral welfare in areas such as nutrition, veterinary care, housing, handling and
                exercise.
